Project preferences

- Be concise and avoid filler language. 
- Do not write too many new files; instead if possible try to improve on existing files. 
- Do not hesitate to offer constructive criticism. 
- Use short, clean names for variables/functions/classes.
- Write clean, minimally working code and do not comment too much or add unrequested functionalities
- When trying to run any package management commands, always use `uv`. Make sure to first navigate to the correct directory, then call `source ~/.venv/bin/activate`, then run all `uv` commands with the flag `--active`. For example, to install a package `pkg_name`, run `uv add --active pkg_name`.
