    "Could you give focused feedback on the structure and how convincingly I explain my motivation for the MS in Data Science? Please don\u2019t rewrite\u2014just flag confusing sections, missing links, or reordering suggestions.\n\nStatement of Purpose:\nI came to data science through frustration with neat equations that broke on messy, real problems. As a statistics major at Lakeside University, my first end-to-end project used Wi\u2011Fi pings to predict library occupancy; it worked technically, but not for students who studied in unlogged corners. That experience\u2014and a summer internship building a model to flag 30\u2011day hospital readmission risk\u2014showed me that predictive accuracy without context can miss the people who need help most.\n\nTo close that gap, I sought work where methods meet impact. As a research assistant in Prof. Anwar\u2019s lab, I helped evaluate the health effects of a wildfire smoke alert policy using a difference\u2011in\u2011differences design. Translating assumptions into tests, I learned that causal framing changes decisions: our results informed the city council\u2019s move to expand clean\u2011air shelters. In a parallel project, I audited an algorithm for resource allocation and found disparate error rates by neighborhood, which led me to study fairness metrics and the limits of observational data.\n\nI now want rigorous training in probabilistic modeling, causal inference, and responsible AI to build systems that are accurate, fair, and useful. The MS in Data Science at River State aligns with this goal: courses like Probabilistic Machine Learning and Causal Inference, and the Responsible AI Lab\u2019s work on interpretability, fit my interests. I hope to work with Prof. Lin on methods for policy evaluation under covariate shift. After the degree, I plan to join a public agency or nonprofit to build decision tools for health and housing. This program offers the mentorship and methodological depth I need to make those tools trustworthy and effective.": [

Also, does the last line land?\n\nAfter the House Emptied\nThe river practiced forgetting under the bridge.\nIt kept the shape of what it carried only a moment,\nthen let the shape unbutton into ripples.\nI packed your shirts into cardboard dusk.\nMoths learned our names from the lampshade.\nThe floor spoke fluent echo.\nI drank the last of the tea; it tasted like keys.\nYour toothbrush stood up straight, a small soldier.\nIn the morning, the river kept rehearsing,\ntaking last night's moon apart, piece by silver piece.\nI wrote to you on the back of a grocery list,\nand the water pronounced it unreadable.": [
