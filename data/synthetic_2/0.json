        "I need help with this calculus optimization problem: A farmer has 2400 ft of fencing and wants to fence off a rectangular field that borders a straight river. He doesn't need a fence along the river. What are the dimensions of the field that would maximize the area? Can you walk me through how to set this up and solve it?",
        "hey can someone explain how to do this??? A box with a square base and open top must have a volume of 32,000 cm\u00b3. Find the dimensions of the box that minimize the amount of material used. i keep getting confused about what the constraint is",
        "I'm stuck on finding the maximum value. The problem says: Find the point on the parabola y = x\u00b2 that is closest to the point (3, 1). I think I need to minimize the distance formula but I'm not sure how to set up the equation properly. Could you show me the steps?",
        "Please help with this optimization word problem for my calc homework: A cylindrical can is to be made to hold 1 liter (1000 cm\u00b3) of oil. Find the dimensions that will minimize the cost of the metal to manufacture the can. I already know V = \u03c0r\u00b2h but don't know what to do next with finding the surface area and taking derivatives"
