        "I just got dumped after 3 years together and I can't stop crying. She said she doesn't love me anymore and needs to find herself. How do I even begin to move on from this? Everything reminds me of her",
        "my ex and i broke up 2 months ago but we still text sometimes and honestly its making it so much harder to heal... should i block them? i know i should but part of me hopes we'll get back together. what would you do?",
        "Hey, I need some advice. My boyfriend of 5 years just ended things out of nowhere last week. I'm struggling with the fact that he's already on dating apps (my friend saw him). It feels like our whole relationship meant nothing to him. How do I stop obsessing over what he's doing and focus on myself? I keep checking his social media even though I know it's unhealthy.",
        "Going through my first real heartbreak at 28. We were planning to move in together next month and now I'm stuck with a lease I can't afford alone. Beyond the practical stuff though, I just feel so lost and empty. Will this feeling ever go away? How long does it usually take to feel normal again after someone breaks your heart?",
        "My partner has been texting their coworker a lot lately and they seem really close. I know it's probably nothing but I can't stop feeling jealous and checking their phone when they're not around. How do I deal with these feelings without ruining my relationship?",
        "hey so i get super jealous whenever my gf talks to other guys even though i know she loves me... its making me act controlling and i hate it. what can i do to stop being so insecure??",
        "I've been with my husband for 10 years and recently he reconnected with an old female friend from college on social media. They comment on each other's posts all the time and it's driving me crazy with jealousy, even though I trust him completely. I don't want to seem like the jealous wife but these feelings are eating me up inside. Can you help me work through this?",
        "Is it normal to feel jealous when your partner gets attention from others? My boyfriend is really attractive and friendly, and I notice how other women look at him and flirt with him. He doesn't flirt back but I still feel this burning jealousy. How can I be more confident and less possessive?",
        "I just found out my partner of 7 years has been having an affair for the past 6 months. I feel completely broken and don't know if I should try to work things out or just leave. They say they're sorry and want to fix things, but how can I ever trust them again? I can't stop replaying everything in my mind and wondering what I did wrong.",
        "My husband cheated on me and we're trying to rebuild our marriage. It's been 3 months since D-day and some days are okay but other days I'm so angry I can barely look at him. He's doing everything right - therapy, being transparent with his phone, etc. but I still feel stuck. How long does this pain last? Will I ever be able to move past this?",
        "hey so my gf emotionally cheated with her coworker (lots of texting, sharing feelings, meeting up secretly but she swears nothing physical happened) and idk what to do... part of me wants to forgive her because i love her but another part of me feels like such an idiot if i stay. everyone says once a cheater always a cheater. is that true? can people actually change after betraying someone?",
        "I need help dealing with intrusive thoughts after being betrayed by my best friend who slept with my ex while we were still together. It happened 8 months ago and I thought I was over it, but I still get triggered by random things - certain songs, places we used to go, even just seeing happy couples. I've lost two important people at once and feel like I can't trust anyone anymore. How do I stop being so bitter and paranoid that everyone will eventually hurt me?",
        "My boyfriend and I have been together for 2 years and he just got a job offer across the country. We're trying to decide if we should do long distance or break up. I love him but I'm scared it won't work out. What should I consider when making this decision?",
        "hey so me and my gf have been doing long distance for 6 months now (college in different states) and lately our video calls feel really awkward and forced... we used to talk for hours but now we run out of things to say after like 20 mins. is this normal or is it a sign we're growing apart??",
        "I need help setting boundaries with my long-distance partner. They want to text constantly throughout the day and get upset when I don't respond immediately, but I have a demanding job and can't always be on my phone. How do I explain that I need space without making them feel insecure about our relationship?",
        "My husband is in the military and we've been apart for 4 months with 8 more to go. I'm really struggling with loneliness and feeling disconnected from him. Sometimes I feel resentful that he chose a career that keeps us apart so much. How can I cope with these feelings and stay strong for our relationship?",
        "My boyfriend and I keep arguing about money. He thinks I spend too much on clothes and going out with friends, but I work hard for my money and feel like I should be able to enjoy it. He makes more than me but is super frugal. How can we stop having the same fight over and over?",
        "I need help dealing with my partner's passive aggressive behavior. Whenever we disagree about something, instead of talking it through, she gives me the silent treatment for days. Like last week I forgot to take out the trash and she didn't speak to me for 3 days. She says nothing's wrong but I can tell she's upset. What should I do?",
        "hey so me and my gf got into a huge fight because she went through my phone while i was sleeping and found texts from a female coworker about a work project but she thinks im cheating which im NOT. now she wants to have access to all my passwords. is this normal or is she being controlling? how do i fix this",
        "My husband and I can't seem to communicate without it turning into a screaming match. We've been married 8 years and have 2 kids. The smallest things set us off - like this morning we fought about how to load the dishwasher. I love him but I'm exhausted from all the conflict. Can you give me strategies to de-escalate when tensions rise?",
        "I've been in love with my best friend for 2 years but they just see me as a friend. It hurts so much seeing them date other people. How do I move on from these feelings without ruining our friendship?",
        "hey so theres this person at work who i really really like but they barely know i exist... i keep fantasizing about us being together but i know its never gonna happen. how do i stop thinking about them all the time? its affecting my productivity",
        "I confessed my feelings to someone I've liked for months and they rejected me kindly, saying they don't feel the same way. I feel so embarrassed and heartbroken. How can I heal from this rejection and regain my self-confidence? I keep replaying the conversation in my head.",
        "Is it normal to still have feelings for someone who doesn't love you back even after trying to move on for 6 months? I've tried dating apps, focusing on hobbies, spending time with friends, but nothing works. I still check their social media daily and it's torture. What else can I do to finally let go?",
        "My ex cheated on me multiple times and really messed me up. I've been dating someone new for 3 months and they're amazing, but I keep checking their phone when they're not looking and I hate myself for it. How do I stop being so paranoid and actually trust them?",
        "I grew up with parents who constantly broke promises and let me down. Now as an adult, I struggle to believe people when they say they care about me or will follow through on things. Even my best friends - I always expect them to abandon me. What are some practical steps to start trusting people again?",
        "hey so i have really bad trust issues from being in an abusive relationship a few years ago... like whenever my current partner goes out with friends i immediately think the worst and spiral into anxiety attacks. they've been nothing but patient with me but i know its exhausting for them too. how can i work on this without pushing them away? i really dont want to lose them because of my past trauma",
        "I want to open up to my partner about my childhood trauma but I'm terrified they'll see me differently or use it against me later. My therapist says sharing could help our relationship but everyone I've ever been vulnerable with has hurt me. How do I know if someone is actually safe to trust with this stuff? What are the signs?",
        "I just started dating someone new about 3 weeks ago and everything is going great, but I can't stop overthinking every little thing. Like if they take a few hours to text back, I immediately think they're losing interest. How do I stop being so anxious and just enjoy this new relationship?",
        "hey so i met this amazing person and we've been on 4 dates now but my anxiety is through the ROOF. i keep thinking im gonna mess it up somehow or that they're too good for me. my last relationship ended badly and i think thats affecting me now. what can i do to calm down and not sabotage this?",
        "I'm in a new relationship (2 months) and I really like this person, but I'm constantly worried about moving too fast or too slow. I analyze every conversation we have and stress about whether I'm being too clingy or too distant. My friends say I'm overthinking but I don't know how to turn off these anxious thoughts. Can you help me manage this anxiety?",
        "Started seeing someone new and the butterflies are intense but so is the anxiety \ud83d\ude05 I find myself checking their social media constantly, wondering who they're with when we're not together, and getting jealous even though I have no reason to be. I know this isn't healthy but idk how to stop these anxious feelings from taking over. Any advice?",
        "My boyfriend keeps checking my phone and gets angry when I talk to other guys, even coworkers. He says it's because he loves me so much and doesn't want to lose me. Last night he threw my phone against the wall when he saw a male colleague texted me about a work project. Am I overreacting by feeling scared? He's never hit me but I'm walking on eggshells all the time.",
        "i think my best friend might be in an abusive relationship but idk how to help her... her husband isolates her from everyone, controls all the money, and she always has to ask permission to go anywhere. she makes excuses for him saying hes just stressed from work. how do i approach this without pushing her away???",
        "Is it normal for a partner to constantly criticize everything about you? My wife tells me daily that I'm stupid, worthless, and lucky she even stays with me. She threatens to take the kids if I ever leave. I feel so trapped and depressed but maybe this is just what marriage is like after 10 years? I don't even recognize myself anymore.",
        "Hey I need some advice. I finally left my toxic ex 3 months ago after 5 years of emotional manipulation and gaslighting. But now I'm struggling with feeling guilty and wondering if I made the right choice. They keep texting saying they've changed and threatening to hurt themselves if I don't come back. Part of me still loves them despite everything. How do I stay strong and not go back?",
        "My partner keeps making plans for us without asking me first, and when I try to bring it up, they say I'm being ungrateful. How can I explain that I need to be consulted about our plans without starting a fight?",
        "I need help setting boundaries with my roommate. They constantly borrow my things without asking and eat my food from the fridge. I've tried dropping hints but they don't get it. What's the best way to have this conversation without ruining our living situation?",
        "how do i tell my family i dont want to come to every single family gathering??? they guilt trip me every time i say no and act like im abandoning them but i just need some weekends to myself sometimes",
        "I've been dating someone for 3 months and they want to see me every single day. I really like them but I need more alone time to recharge. How can I communicate that I need space without making them think I'm losing interest? I'm worried they'll take it the wrong way and think I want to break up.",
        "My parents hate my boyfriend because he's from a different religion than us. They've threatened to cut me off financially if I don't break up with him. We've been together for 2 years and I love him but I'm also really close with my family. How do I handle this situation without losing either of them?",
        "hey so my mom found out im dating someone 10 years older than me (im 25) and she completely freaked out... she keeps saying theyre taking advantage of me and wont even meet them. its been really stressful and causing fights every time we talk. what should i do??",
        "I need advice. My family doesn't approve of my same-sex relationship and they keep making passive-aggressive comments at family gatherings. My partner feels unwelcome and I'm torn between standing up for our relationship and keeping peace with my relatives. How can I set boundaries while still maintaining some kind of relationship with my family?",
        "My parents are upset that I'm dating someone who already has kids from a previous marriage. They keep saying I'm making a mistake and that I should find someone without 'baggage.' It's really hurtful because I love my partner and have grown close to their children too. How do I get my family to accept my choice and stop being so judgmental?",
        "My partner keeps complaining that I'm always working late and missing dinner with the family. I'm trying to get promoted and need to put in extra hours, but they don't seem to understand. How can I make them see that I'm doing this for our future?",
        "hey so i've been dating someone for 6 months and things were great when we were both WFH during covid but now that we're back in office full time we barely see each other... we're both exhausted after work and weekends feel like we're just catching up on chores. is this normal or are we doomed?",
        "I need help setting boundaries with work. My job is demanding and I love what I do, but my wife says I'm emotionally unavailable when I get home because I'm still thinking about work problems. She's threatening couples therapy if things don't change. What should I do to be more present at home without sacrificing my career goals?",
        "My boyfriend and I both have high-stress careers (he's a surgeon, I'm in investment banking). We maybe have one real conversation a week that isn't about logistics. We love each other but feel like roommates who happen to sleep in the same bed. Should we just accept this is what adult relationships are like, or is there something we can do to reconnect despite our crazy schedules?",
        "I've been dating someone for 6 months and they want to take things to the next level emotionally, but every time they try to have deep conversations or share personal stuff, I completely shut down and change the subject. I know I'm pushing them away but I can't help it. How do I stop being so scared of letting someone in?",
        "my partner keeps saying i never open up about my feelings and its causing problems. honestly they're right - i find it almost impossible to be vulnerable even though we've been together 2 years. i grew up in a family where showing emotions was seen as weakness. any advice on how to start being more emotionally available?",
        "Hey, I need help with something that's been bothering me. My girlfriend of 8 months recently told me she loves me, and I literally panicked and said 'thanks' before making an excuse to leave. The truth is I have feelings for her too but saying it out loud feels terrifying. I've been hurt before in past relationships. How can I work through this fear of emotional intimacy before I ruin what we have?",
        "I just started seeing this amazing person but I'm already self-sabotaging. Whenever things start feeling too real or intimate, I pick fights or find reasons why it won't work out. My therapist says I have intimacy issues from childhood trauma but knowing that doesn't make it easier to stop the pattern. What are some practical steps I can take to slowly build my capacity for vulnerability without running away?",
        "My boyfriend is from India and his parents are really upset that he's dating someone outside their culture. They keep pressuring him to break up with me and find someone from their community. He loves me but also doesn't want to lose his family. I don't know what to do - should I just end things to make it easier for him?",
        "I need help!! My latina girlfriend gets so offended when I don't want to go to every single family gathering and there's literally one every weekend. In my white american family we see each other maybe once a month. She says I'm being disrespectful but I just need space sometimes. How can I explain this without her thinking I hate her family?",
        "Me and my partner come from different religious backgrounds (I'm Jewish, she's Catholic) and we've been together 3 years. Now we're talking about marriage and kids and suddenly everything is complicated. Her family wants a church wedding, mine wants a rabbi, and we can't agree on how to raise future children. Is this relationship doomed or is there a way through this?",
        "hey so i'm dating someone from japan and the communication style is driving me crazy... they never directly say what they want and expect me to just understand from context?? like yesterday they said 'maybe we could consider possibly thinking about dinner' and apparently that meant they were really hungry and wanted to eat RIGHT NOW. i'm american and i'm used to people just saying what they mean. how do i navigate this without constantly misunderstanding each other",
        "My boyfriend has been struggling with severe depression for the past 6 months and I'm feeling completely drained. I love him but I don't know how much more I can take. He refuses to get professional help and gets angry when I bring it up. How do I support him without losing myself in the process?",
        "hey i need some advice... my wife has anxiety and panic attacks and sometimes i feel like nothing i do helps. i try to be supportive but sometimes i get frustrated and then i feel guilty about it. is it normal to feel this way? what can i do better?",
        "I've been dating someone for 2 years who has bipolar disorder. When they're in a manic episode, they make impulsive decisions that affect both of us (like spending our savings or quitting jobs). During depressive episodes, they push me away completely. I want to be there for them, but I'm starting to feel resentful and I hate myself for it. How do other people handle relationships like this? I feel so alone.",
        "My partner was recently diagnosed with PTSD from childhood trauma. They have nightmares almost every night and sometimes have flashbacks during the day. They're in therapy but progress is slow. I want to create a safe environment for them but I'm walking on eggshells all the time, worried I'll trigger something. Can you give me practical tips for supporting someone with PTSD while also maintaining my own mental health?",
        "My husband passed away 3 months ago after 30 years of marriage. I can't seem to function normally anymore - I forget to eat, I can't sleep, and I keep expecting him to walk through the door. Everyone says I should be 'moving on' by now but I feel stuck. How do I even begin to process this grief?",
        "hey i lost my girlfriend in a car accident last year and i still cry every day. is this normal? my friends dont understand why im not dating yet",
        "I'm struggling with survivor's guilt after my wife died from cancer. We had plans to travel the world in retirement, and now I'm here alone with all these dreams we'll never fulfill together. I feel guilty for still being alive when she's not. How do other widows/widowers cope with this feeling?",
        "My partner of 8 years died suddenly from a heart attack two weeks ago and I'm completely lost. I don't know how to handle all the practical things like funeral arrangements and paperwork while I can barely get out of bed. I also have two kids who are devastated. What should I prioritize right now and how can I support my children when I can barely support myself?",
        "I've been dating someone amazing for 8 months and they want to move in together, but every time they bring it up I feel this overwhelming panic and make excuses. I really care about them but I'm terrified of taking the next step. How do I know if this is just normal nervousness or if I have real commitment issues?",
        "my boyfriend proposed last night and instead of being happy i just felt trapped and scared. we've been together 3 years and i love him but now i cant stop thinking about running away. is something wrong with me? why cant i just be excited like a normal person",
        "I keep sabotaging my relationships right when they start getting serious. Like clockwork, around the 6 month mark I start picking fights, finding flaws, or just pulling away emotionally. I'm 34 and I'm worried I'll never be able to commit to anyone. Can you help me understand why I do this and how to stop?",
        "Hey, so I need some advice... I've always been the type who values independence and freedom, but now I'm in a relationship where my partner wants more commitment (exclusive labels, meeting families, future planning etc). Part of me wants these things too but another part feels like I'm losing myself. How do I balance my need for autonomy with building a committed relationship?",
        "My partner and I keep fighting about money. I make more than them and pay for most things, but they get upset when I want to budget or track expenses. They say I'm being controlling but I'm just stressed about our future. How do I talk to them about this without making things worse?",
        "hey so me and my boyfriend are basically broke rn and its putting so much strain on us... we snap at each other all the time now and i dont even remember the last time we did something fun together. i love him but sometimes i wonder if we're just too stressed to make this work. what should i do?",
        "I recently lost my job and haven't told my wife yet. It's been 2 weeks and I'm terrified she'll leave me if she finds out we might lose the house. I've been pretending to go to work every day while actually job hunting. The guilt and anxiety are eating me alive. How do I come clean to her? I'm scared this will destroy our marriage.",
        "Is it normal to resent your partner during financial hardship? My husband's business failed 6 months ago and we've been living off my salary alone. I know it's not his fault but I can't help feeling angry when I see him at home while I work overtime. I feel like a terrible person for thinking this way. How can I be more supportive when I'm exhausted and bitter?",
        "My partner and I have been together for 3 years and we're thinking about opening up our relationship. We love each other deeply but we're both curious about exploring connections with other people. How do we even begin this conversation without hurting each other? I'm scared of ruining what we have.",
        "I'm in a polyamorous relationship with two partners who both know about each other. Lately I've been feeling like I'm not giving enough time to either of them and the guilt is eating me up. One partner needs more emotional support right now due to work stress, but my other partner is feeling neglected. How do I balance everyone's needs including my own without burning out?",
        "hey so i've been dating someone for 6 months who told me from the start they're poly and have another partner. i thought i'd be cool with it but honestly the jealousy is killing me whenever they're with their other partner. i don't want to be the person who asks them to change but idk if i can do this. should i just end it or try to work through these feelings?",
        "I need help setting boundaries in my open marriage. My husband and I agreed to open things up a year ago, but he's been seeing the same person regularly and I feel like it's becoming too much like a second relationship rather than just casual dating. We didn't really establish clear rules at the beginning. What kind of boundaries are reasonable to ask for now, and how do I bring this up without sounding controlling?",
        "I'm 24 and recently started dating someone who's 41. My friends keep making comments about the age difference and saying it's weird. How do I deal with their judgment while also figuring out if this relationship is actually right for me?",
        "My partner is 15 years younger than me and sometimes I worry we're in different life stages - I'm thinking about retirement planning while they're focused on career growth. Any advice on navigating these differences without letting it create distance between us?",
        "hey so im in a relationship with someone significantly older and my parents absolutely hate it... they think im being taken advantage of but i genuinely love this person. how can i get my family to see that this is a real relationship and not just some phase or mistake?",
        "I've been married to my husband for 3 years (I'm 35, he's 52) and lately I've been feeling insecure about aging. I worry that as I get older he'll lose interest, which I know sounds irrational since he's older, but I can't shake the feeling. How do I work through these insecurities without pushing him away?",
        "My mother-in-law constantly criticizes how I parent my kids. She makes passive aggressive comments about their behavior and implies I'm not raising them right. It's making family gatherings unbearable and my spouse just says 'that's how she is.' How do I handle this without causing a huge family rift?",
        "I need help!! My in laws keep showing up at our house unannounced like 3-4 times a week and staying for hours. They have a key and just let themselves in. My husband thinks its totally normal but I feel like I have no privacy anymore. Am I being unreasonable? What should I do?",
        "My father-in-law makes really inappropriate jokes and comments that make me uncomfortable. Last week at dinner he made a comment about my weight and everyone just laughed it off. My partner says he doesn't mean anything by it and I'm being too sensitive. I dread seeing him now. How can I set boundaries without seeming like the difficult daughter-in-law?",
        "hey so i've been married for 2 years and my wife's parents still treat me like i'm not good enough for her. they constantly bring up her ex who was a doctor (i work in retail management) and make little digs about our apartment being small. my wife defends me sometimes but not always. its really affecting my self esteem and our marriage. what can i do to improve this situation?",
        "I've been working from home for 2 years now and I barely see anyone anymore. My friends have all moved away or gotten busy with their families. I feel so disconnected from everyone and don't know how to make new connections at this point in my life. What can I do to feel less alone?",
        "hey, feeling really isolated lately... moved to a new city for a job 6 months ago and still haven't made any friends. weekends are the worst when I see everyone posting about hanging out and I'm just sitting at home. any advice?",
        "I'm struggling with severe loneliness after my divorce. I'm 45 and feel like everyone my age already has their established friend groups and I don't fit in anywhere. My kids are with their other parent half the time and those nights alone are unbearable. How do I cope with this overwhelming feeling of isolation?",
        "Can you help me understand why I feel lonely even when I'm surrounded by people? Like I'll be at work or family gatherings but still feel completely disconnected and isolated from everyone around me. Is this normal and what can I do about it?",
        "I got rejected from my dream job after 3 rounds of interviews and they said I wasn't a good fit. I feel like such a failure and I'm questioning everything about myself. How do I stop feeling so worthless and build my confidence back up?",
        "hey, so this girl i really liked just told me she only sees me as a friend... i feel so stupid for thinking she was into me. now i don't even want to leave my apartment. what can i do to feel better about myself again?",
        "My ex-husband left me for someone younger and prettier 6 months ago. I'm 47 and feel like nobody will ever want me again. I look in the mirror and hate what I see. Can you help me work on rebuilding my self-worth? I don't know where to start.",
        "Just got a rejection letter from the university I applied to for my Master's program. This is the third rejection in a row and I'm starting to think I'm just not smart enough. Everyone around me seems to be succeeding while I keep failing. How can I develop better self-esteem when everything keeps going wrong?",
        "I think I might be in a codependent relationship with my partner. I constantly worry about their mood and feel responsible for making them happy, even when it means sacrificing my own needs. I can't seem to make decisions without checking with them first, and when they're upset, I feel like it's always my fault. How do I know if this is actually codependency, and what can I do to become more independent while still maintaining our relationship?",
        "my therapist says im codependent with my mom and honestly i dont even know what that means?? like yeah i call her every day and she still does my laundry even though im 28 but isnt that just being close with family? she gets really upset when i dont visit and i feel terrible about it. can you explain what codependency actually is and help me figure out if this is unhealthy or not",
        "I've been reading about codependency and I'm starting to realize I have this pattern in all my relationships - romantic, friendships, even at work. I'm always the 'fixer' who tries to solve everyone's problems, and I feel anxious when people don't need me. I base my entire self-worth on being helpful and needed by others. What are some practical steps I can take to break this cycle? I want to have healthier boundaries but I don't know where to start.",
        "Help! I just ended a 5-year relationship and my ex keeps saying I'm codependent. They said I was too clingy, that I had no identity outside of 'us,' and that I enabled their bad habits by always making excuses for them. Now I'm terrified of getting into another relationship and repeating the same patterns. How do I heal from codependency? Should I stay single for a while? I really don't want to mess up my next relationship with these issues.",
        "My husband and I have been married for 12 years and we've decided to separate. We have two kids, ages 8 and 10. How do I tell them about this without traumatizing them? I'm so scared of messing this up.",
        "going through a divorce right now and my ex keeps texting me mean things about how I ruined everything. I know I shouldn't respond but it hurts so much. How do I stop feeling guilty when they keep blaming me for everything that went wrong?",
        "I'm thinking about filing for divorce but I'm terrified of being alone. I'm 45 and haven't been single since college. My marriage isn't abusive or anything, we just grew apart and I feel so empty. Is it wrong to leave when there's nothing 'really' wrong? How do I know if I'm making the right choice?",
        "Hey, I need help dealing with my emotions after my wife asked for a separation last week. I thought we were fine but apparently she's been unhappy for years. I keep cycling between anger, sadness, and desperately wanting to fix things. She says she needs space but I can't stop myself from calling her. How do I respect her boundaries when I'm falling apart?",

        "I always self-sabotage before first dates by either canceling last minute or showing up but being so nervous that I can't be myself. I really want to break this pattern. The anxiety just builds up so much that I feel physically sick. What can I do differently this time to actually enjoy the experience?",
        "Going on a coffee date Saturday and already overthinking everything - what to wear, what to say, where to sit, whether to hug hello or just wave?? \ud83d\ude05 My last relationship ended 6 months ago and getting back out there feels terrifying. How do people make this look so easy?",

        "I've been dating someone for 6 months and I think we have incompatible love languages. I do all these thoughtful things for them (cooking, cleaning, fixing stuff) but they seem unimpressed. Meanwhile they keep saying 'I love you' expecting me to say it back but words don't come naturally to me. Is this relationship doomed or can people with different love languages make it work?",

        "I'm graduating college next month and moving back home while my boyfriend has another year left at school. Everyone keeps saying college relationships don't survive after graduation.

        "My partner and I have been together for 3 years and everything is great except in the bedroom. They want sex way more often than I do and it's causing tension.

        "I need help. My husband has a much lower sex drive than me and it's making me feel undesired and rejected. We've talked about it but nothing changes. I love him but I'm starting to resent him and even thinking about cheating. What should I do?",
        "hey so this is awkward but my gf wants to try things in bed that make me uncomfortable... like really kinky stuff that i'm just not into. she says i'm boring and not adventurous enough. i don't want to lose her but i also don't want to do things i'm not comfortable with. any advice?",
        "I recently discovered that I might be asexual, but I'm in a long-term relationship with someone who has a normal sex drive.

        "I was in an emotionally abusive relationship for 3 years and even though it's been over a year since we broke up, I still flinch when someone raises their voice or gets angry around me.

        "Hey, I need some advice. I grew up watching my parents have a really toxic relationship full of screaming matches and emotional manipulation.

How do I break this cycle when it's all I've ever known?",
        "I can't seem to move past what happened with my ex-husband. He was controlling about money, who I could see, what I wore, everything. It's been 2 years since the divorce but I still feel paralyzed when it comes to making decisions on my own. Sometimes I hear his criticizing voice in my head telling me I'm stupid or worthless. Will I ever feel like myself again? How long does healing from this kind of relationship usually take?",

How do I build a relationship with them without seeming like I'm trying to replace their dad?",

The issue is he has a 7-year-old son from a previous relationship, and I've never lived with a child before. I love my boyfriend but I'm terrified of suddenly becoming a stepmom figure. What should I consider before taking this step? How do I know if I'm ready for this kind of responsibility?",
        "I've been dating someone for 6 months and they're amazing, but whenever I try to have deeper conversations about feelings or our future, they shut down or change the subject. How do I know if they're just emotionally unavailable or if I'm being too pushy?",
        "my therapist told me i have emotional availability issues but i dont really get what that means??? like i care about people but i just dont like talking about heavy stuff all the time. is this something i actually need to work on or is it just how some people are",
