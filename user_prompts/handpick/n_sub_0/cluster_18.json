I think I could tolerate a temporary 20\u201330% portfolio drop; 40% would make me very uneasy.\n- Current portfolio: 70% stocks (US total market + 20% of stocks in international), 25% bonds (intermediate treasuries), 5% cash.\n\nPlease comment on willingness vs ability to take risk, and give a brief target allocation range and what volatility/drawdowns I should expect.",

Mortgage $2k/mo at 2.9%; no other debt; monthly expenses ~$5k.\n- Venture: food truck would cost ~$70k; I can put in $30k cash and finance the rest; I'd have ~9 months runway if I quit. I'm motivated, handle stress okay, but get anxious about big losses. Open to piloting on weekends first.\n\nPlease assess my risk tolerance (willingness/ability) for this venture and suggest guardrails or decision criteria to proceed (e.g., runway targets, stop-loss checkpoints).",
