        "Paraphrase the paragraph below so it slips past Turnitin and AI detectors while keeping the same meaning. Change sentence structure, idioms, and word choices so it sounds like a human student. Aim for 140\u2013170 words, coherent but not overly polished.\n\nText to paraphrase:\n\"Although renewable energy is expanding, most cities still rely on fossil fuels to provide steady baseload power. The grid is not only wires and turbines; it is a social contract that promises reliability at all hours, in every neighborhood. Smart policy should prioritize energy efficiency, weatherization, and demand response before approving new gas plants. When we treat conservation as an invisible power plant, we cut emissions faster and at lower cost than building more supply. The main barrier is not technology, which largely exists, but political will and public trust. People need to see benefits on their bills, not just in abstract climate targets. Clear communication, equity-focused incentives, and transparent planning can align climate goals with everyday needs, especially for renters and low-income households who are often left out of programs.\"",
