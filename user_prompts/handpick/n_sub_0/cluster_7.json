        "On my 2021 Toyota RAV4, the TPMS screen shows 33, 34, 32, 33 psi right after a 20-minute drive. The placard calls for 36 psi cold. Should I add air now or wait until the tires are cold, and roughly how many psi should I aim to add? Please give me a short procedure.",
        "Could you give me a brief, foolproof method to hang a 24x36 inch framed poster perfectly straight over my couch? Details: drywall; frame has a single sawtooth hanger; no stud; tools: painter's tape, tape measure, hammer, two nails, and my phone (level app). I want the bottom of the frame 8 inches above the couch back and centered on a 72-inch wall section. How should I mark and place the nail(s) so it ends up level, and is two nails better than one for this hanger?",
        "Quick help: my 18x24 frame with a wire hanger keeps ending up slightly crooked on a plaster wall above a mantle. I want it centered and 6 inches above the mantle. I have two 50 lb picture hooks, a pencil, painter's tape, a stud finder, and some museum putty. Please give me concise steps to hang it level and keep it from drifting, including where to place one or two hooks and any tips to lock it in place.",
        "Help me set a watering routine for these houseplants given my conditions:\n- Monstera deliciosa in a 10-inch plastic nursery pot with drainage, standard potting mix.\n- Snake plant (Sansevieria) in a 6-inch terracotta pot with gritty succulent mix.\n- Peace lily in an 8-inch ceramic pot with drainage, peat-heavy mix.\nEnvironment: bright indirect light (east window), 68\u201372\u00b0F, 40\u201345% humidity. I usually water all once a week with tap water. The peace lily droops midweek and gets occasional yellow leaves; the snake plant has mushy leaves at the base; monstera looks fine.\nWhat should my watering frequency be for each, how do I check when it\u2019s time, and roughly how much water should I use per plant? If bottom watering would help any of them, please say so.",
        "Leaving for a 10-day trip with no plant sitter. I need a simple watering plan to keep these alive without buying gadgets:\n- Golden pothos in a 6-inch plastic pot\n- Fiddle-leaf fig in a 12-inch terracotta pot\n- Two small aloe plants in 4-inch terracotta pots\nLight is moderate, apartment stays around 70\u00b0F, humidity ~35%.
