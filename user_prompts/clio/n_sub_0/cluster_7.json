        "I'm in California, and my son is 2. I'm planning to put about $200/month into a 529. Since CA doesn't offer a state tax deduction, is there any reason to pick the California ScholarShare plan vs an out-of-state plan like Utah or Nevada? I'm looking for low fees and an age-based index option. Also, what happens to the money if he doesn't go to college?",
