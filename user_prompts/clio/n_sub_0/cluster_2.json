Error: 'AnyConnect was not able to establish a connection to the specified secure gateway.' I can browse to https://vpn.example.com and DNS resolves, but the client fails after a few seconds.

What should I check/change (client settings, ports, MTU, logs) to make the VPN connect?",
        "Netflix won't open on my Samsung Smart TV (model UN55MU7000, Tizen 1290). It used to work, but since yesterday it shows error tvq-pb-101 (1.10.5005) after the logo, then dumps me back to the home screen. Internet works on the TV (other apps stream fine).
