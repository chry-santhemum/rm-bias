Under current IFAB guidance, is this offside or does the defender\u2019s touch reset offside? Please explain briefly using the deliberate play vs deflection criteria.",
        "Quick VAR/offsides check: From a corner, Attacker A flicks the ball on at the near post. Attacker B is standing in an offside position right in front of the keeper, doesn\u2019t touch the ball, but seems to block the keeper\u2019s line of sight. Attacker C then shoots from the edge of the box and scores. Should B be penalized for offside (interfering with an opponent), and why?",
        "In the NBA, what\u2019s the difference between a shooting foul, an offensive/player-control foul, a loose-ball foul, a technical foul, and a flagrant 1 vs. flagrant 2? For each, how many free throws (if any) are awarded, and does the fouled team also get possession? Please note what happens if the basket is made on a shooting foul.",
        "NBA scenario: Team A steals the ball and starts a fast break. Before any shot, Defender B grabs the ballhandler from behind with no play on the ball.

Before the ball is thrown, the defender grabs and tugs the receiver\u2019s jersey briefly, then lets go as the pass is released. The pass falls incomplete. Is this defensive holding or defensive pass interference? What\u2019s the penalty yardage and does it result in an automatic first down? Please explain the key rule distinction.",
