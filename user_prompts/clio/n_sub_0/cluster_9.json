        "I\u2019m a renter in a 700 sq ft, 1-bedroom apartment in Chicago. Electricity use averages ~350 kWh/month, natural gas ~30 therms/month (heating and stove). I commute 10 miles each way by car (30 mpg) four days a week. I can\u2019t make major building changes (no solar, no window replacements), and I\u2019ve got about $200 upfront and up to $30/month to spend. What are the 5 most impactful steps I can take this year to reduce my carbon footprint, in order of impact, with rough annual CO2e savings and any simple cost/payback notes?",
        "I need to travel from Boston to Washington, DC next month with one other person (so 2 travelers total).

Please estimate per-person CO2e for a one-way trip and say which is best, plus 2 quick tips to reduce emissions for the chosen mode.",
        "I live in a 1,600 sq ft single-story ranch built in 1978 in Minneapolis (very cold winters). The house feels drafty; the attic has ~6 inches of old fiberglass, the attic hatch isn\u2019t insulated, weatherstripping on exterior doors is worn, and there are several recessed can lights under the attic. Windows are older double-pane with minor leaks. Heat is a 90% AFUE gas furnace from 2010. Utility rates: electricity $0.16/kWh, gas $1.10/therm. I\u2019ve got $800 and a weekend, plus basic tools. What 3\u20135 projects should I prioritize for the biggest comfort and energy savings right away, with rough material recommendations and ballpark costs?",

        "I'm a renter in Boston trying to go greener without installing anything. Two options I'm considering:\n- Community solar subscription that applies bill credits equal to my usage with a guaranteed 10% discount on those credits; 20-year contract, $200 early termination fee.\n- My utility's green power program that adds 100% wind/solar RECs for an extra $0.02/kWh with no contract.\nMy average use is 450 kWh/month, and my base energy rate is about $0.26/kWh. Which option likely costs less over the next few years, and which has the bigger environmental impact? Any gotchas I should know about?",

Please also touch on typical panel/inverter warranties and whether a grid-tied system will power the home during an outage without a battery.",
        "Help me understand the wind speed\u2013power relationship. If a turbine at Site A sees an average wind speed of 6 m/s and the same model at Site B sees 7 m/s, roughly how much higher might Site B\u2019s annual energy output be, assuming similar wind distributions and availability? A simple rule-of-thumb using the cubic relationship is fine.",
