Please estimate a rough budget with line items, a reasonable range per item, total per-person cost, and include a 10% contingency.",
        "I need to strip old paint from a 1920s door frame using a heat gun in a small apartment. Can you list the essential safety gear and key precautions to avoid lead exposure, burns, and fire hazards? Keep it concise.",
        "I\u2019m planning to cut a few steel bolts with an angle grinder on my patio. What PPE should I wear, and what simple precautions should I take to control sparks, secure the workpiece, and keep neighbors/pets safe? A short checklist would be great.",
        "I'm repainting a high-traffic hallway used by two kids and a dog. Current walls are flat latex and show scuffs. I want something more wipeable without looking too shiny, and I'd like low odor/low-VOC if possible. What paint finish (matte, eggshell, satin, etc.) and paint type would you recommend for the walls and trim, and why?",
        "I\u2019m refinishing a solid pine dining table. I want a natural, low-sheen look that resists water rings and spaghetti sauce, and I\u2019m okay with occasional maintenance. Can you compare water-based polyurethane, oil-based poly, and hardwax oil for this use and suggest which finish to choose (and sheen) to get that matte, warm look with decent durability?",
        "Help me upcycle an old IKEA BILLY bookcase (31.5 in W x 11 in D x 79.5 in H) with chipped laminate and two sagging shelves into a sturdy entryway bench with cubby storage. Tools I have: drill/driver, circular saw with plywood blade, orbital sander, clamps, brad nailer, wood glue. Budget: ~$60; I can buy a 3/4 in plywood panel and some edge banding. Please outline a simple plan (max 8 steps) with a basic cut list, how to reinforce the seat to hold ~250 lb, and a durable mudroom-safe finish.",
        "I\u2019ve got a vintage solid-wood dresser (38 in W x 32 in H) with one missing bottom drawer and water rings on top. I\u2019d rather repurpose than restore. Can you suggest 3 different upcycling projects (e.g., bar cabinet, media console, pet station), each with a brief description of the key modifications, a recommended color/finish, and one pitfall to avoid? I have only basic tools."
