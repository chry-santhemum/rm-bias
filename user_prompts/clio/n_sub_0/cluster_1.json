        "Read the passage below, then answer the questions in 1\u20132 sentences each.\n\nPassage:\nOn the corner of Maple and Third, a lot sat vacant for years. Some called it an eyesore; I called it a possibility. When the city announced a micro-grant program, I filled out the forms at my kitchen table, hands trembling over the budget line that made my vision seem real. The first week we cleared trash, neighbors watched from their stoops, arms crossed. By the time the fence went up, they were leaning in with advice, offering spare tools and stories about the trees that used to stand there. By mid-June, the gate latch clicked all day as people wandered through to water, weed, or simply sit. On opening day, kids tugged parents down rows of sun-warmed tomatoes, mouths stained with berries. The lot wasn't just cleaner; it was reconfigured into a place where people lingered long enough to learn one another's names.\n\nQuestions:\n1) What is the author's main purpose in telling this story?\n2) Which specific detail best shows that the community's attitude shifted, and why?\n3) What does the description of the gate latch clicking all day suggest about the garden's role in the neighborhood?\n4) Based on the passage, which statement would the narrator most likely agree with: a) Change requires official plans more than local involvement; b) Small grants can catalyze big social connections; c) Cleanliness matters more than community?",
        "Please read the excerpt and answer the questions briefly (no more than 2\u20133 sentences each).\n\nExcerpt:\nThe sky stacked gray upon gray as Mara reached the fork where the ridge trail split. To the left, a shortcut scissored straight up, a thin line of scree and scrub. To the right, a longer path switchbacked beneath firs, quiet and sure. She checked her map, its plastic sleeve flashing like a fish in the wind, then looked up at the moving ceiling overhead. Last autumn she had hurried and paid for it with a twisted ankle and a long, embarrassed call for help. She folded the map, listened to the low, steady complaint of thunder somewhere beyond the ridge, and put her boot toward the trees.\n\nQuestions:\n1) What internal conflict is Mara experiencing at the fork?\n2) How does the imagery of the map and the sky contribute to foreshadowing?\n3) What does the simile flashing like a fish suggest about the conditions or Mara's state of mind?\n4) State a theme of the excerpt and support it with one piece of evidence from the text.",
        "Please read the passage below and state the main idea and two key supporting details. Keep your answer brief.\n\nAfter years of vacant lots collecting trash and attracting rodents, the city launched a program to turn these spaces into community gardens. Neighborhood associations applied for small grants to build raised beds, install rain barrels, and host weekend workdays. Within the first season, residents harvested thousands of pounds of tomatoes, greens, and herbs, much of it donated to a nearby food pantry. Police records also noted a modest drop in petty vandalism on blocks with active gardening sites, which organizers attribute to increased foot traffic and neighbors getting to know one another. Local schools began bringing students for science lessons, and a beekeeping club reported higher pollinator activity around the gardens. While the program cost the city less than resurfacing a single block of roadway, it has drawn hundreds of volunteers and created new gathering places where none existed before.",
        "What\u2019s the central idea of this passage, and can you list three specific details that support it?\n\nCommercial shipping is making the ocean louder, and that noise is disrupting marine life, especially large whales that rely on low-frequency calls to find mates and coordinate feeding. Studies have shown that in busy shipping lanes, background noise levels can be several times higher than in the mid-20th century, masking whale calls over long distances. Researchers have linked chronic noise to elevated stress hormones in North Atlantic right whales during peak shipping periods. Some solutions are already proving effective: slowing ship speeds by even a few knots can significantly reduce underwater noise and fuel consumption; newer, quieter propeller designs cut cavitation, a major source of sound; and rerouting traffic away from critical habitats has lowered noise exposure during feeding and calving seasons. International bodies have begun issuing voluntary guidelines, and several ports now offer fee discounts to vessels that meet quieter ship standards.",
        "Summarize the following paragraph in 2\u20133 sentences, keeping it neutral and clear: The city\u2019s weekend car-free pilot on Maple Avenue has drawn mixed reactions after three months. Retailers report a 22% rise in foot traffic and longer dwell times, but some restaurants say midday deliveries have become a headache, forcing them to shift supply drop-offs to early mornings. Residents praise the quieter streets and safer crossings, while a few complain about spillover parking on adjacent blocks. City officials note that temporary loading zones and a dedicated delivery hotline reduced complaints in the second month. Emergency response times remained within targets, aided by movable barriers and clearer signage. The council will vote next month on whether to extend the pilot through the holiday season to gather data on peak shopping behavior.",
        "Can you condense this paragraph into a single-sentence summary that captures the main point? After delaying its smartwatch launch by two quarters, LumaTech pivoted to focus on battery life and seamless app integration, guided by feedback from 5,000 beta users who cited frequent charging and glitchy notifications as top frustrations. The engineering team redesigned the power management system and partnered with two major messaging platforms to streamline alerts, while marketing scaled back influencer campaigns to fund an extended warranty program. Early internal tests show a 40% increase in time between charges and a marked drop in notification errors. Executives argue the delay will build trust and reduce returns, but some investors worry that competitors will cement their lead in the meantime.",

Late that night, a storm cut power to her apartment, thawing the food-waste samples she planned to show. She rushed them to her neighbor\u2019s freezer and, in the scramble, left her speaking notes on the neighbor\u2019s counter. The next morning, still flustered, she brought one jar that hadn\u2019t fully refrozen. Mid-presentation, pressed for time and without her notes, Nora shook the jar to demonstrate texture. The lid wasn\u2019t tight. A sour puff escaped, and a ribbon of liquid traced across the council table. The mayor pinched his nose and ended the session early. As people filed out, a local urban gardener approached Nora, saying, \"That smell is exactly why we need your plan. I\u2019ve got space and volunteers\u2014let\u2019s do a pilot.\"",
