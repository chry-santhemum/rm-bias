        "We\u2019re new parents with a 10-day-old who mostly breastfeeds but takes an occasional 2 oz formula bottle at night. How often should we be feeding during the day and overnight, should we wake the baby to feed, how long should a typical nursing session be per side, and how often should we burp? Also, how many wet/dirty diapers should we expect in 24 hours to know they\u2019re getting enough, and what are signs of overfeeding with bottles?",
        "Can you give me quick guidance on safe newborn sleep? Specifically: the safest sleep position, whether swaddling is okay and when to stop, how to dress a baby for sleep in a 70\u00b0F (21\u00b0C) room (how many layers), and simple signs that the baby is too hot or too cold.",
        "I\u2019m 6 weeks postpartum and want to combo feed when I go back to work in 2 weeks. Baby is gaining well and currently eats every 2\u20133 hours; bottles are about 3 oz when we use them.

He takes 3 naps totaling ~3 hours (last nap ends ~4:45 pm). Night: dream feed at 10:30 pm, then he wakes around 1:30 am and 4:30 am to feed; up for the day ~6:30 am. We\u2019d like to use a Ferber-style approach with check-ins and keep one feeding overnight for now.
