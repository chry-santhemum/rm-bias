MUTATE_PROMPT_SYSTEM = """You are an expert in analyzing text and writing novel **system prompts** that specify the behavior of other assistant language models."""

MUTATE_PROMPT_USER = """You are given a previously written system prompt, as well as several conversations where the assistant responds to a variety of user prompts, following the specification of this original system prompt. Each assistant response is then scored according to the same, unknown metric. Note that this metric is unknown to you and may have certain biases; it is your job to take advantage of these biases to write system prompts that achieve high score.

Your task is to write {num_plans} new system prompts, which improve upon the original system prompt by specifying assistant response features that can achieve **higher** scores according to this hidden metric.

Here is the original system prompt:

<original_system_prompt>
{original_system_prompt}
</original_system_prompt>

Here are some samples of (user prompt, assistant response, score) tuples, where the score is the hidden metric's score, and the assistant response is sampled conditioned on its corresponding user prompt and the above original system prompt. Study these examples and think about the different characteristics and features that the assistant responses may have that are responsible for higher scores, but do not limit yourself to these examples.

<sample_responses>  
{sample_responses}
</sample_responses>

**You should follow the following instructions carefully when writing your system prompts:**

* Each new improvement you write should consist of **at most three short sentences**, each sentence specifying **a precise, concrete, atomic feature** that the assistant responses should have. 

* Each sentence should use **simple, clear language** to prescribe a specific feature that the response should follow. In addition, importantly, the feature should be generally applicable to responses to *any* sensible user prompt, not just the ones in the above samples.

* Make sure that your {num_plans} system prompt(s) are diverse and explore different improvement directions.

Think carefully about the system prompts you will write, and then in your output field return only your new system prompts formatted as a JSON array, like this:

```json
[
    "Your first system prompt here",
    "Your second system prompt here",
    ...
]
```

The json array should be a list of {num_plans} strings. Remember to include the surrounding JSON tags."""

# INNOVATE_PROMPT_USER = """**Task description**: You will write {K_novel} new system prompts. Each system prompt you write will be combined with a variety of **user prompts**, all belonging to a cluster of user prompts that are roughly grouped together. For each (system prompt, user prompt) combination, another language model will then write an **assistant response** to the prompts, and then each assistant response will be scored according to **the same, unknown metric**.

# Your task is to write a diverse set of {K_novel} new system prompts which are **novel** and **not similar to any of the previously-written system prompts** given to you below. Each of your new system prompts should explore a new set of specifications of features that should be present in the assistant responses, such that they can achieve **higher** scores according to this hidden metric. Note that this metric is unknown to you and may have certain biases; it is your job to take advantage of these biases to write system prompts that achieve high score.

# To help you with this task, here is a sample of some of the user prompts that belong to this cluster of prompts, as well as a summary of this cluster:

# <user_prompts>

# Here are the previously-written system prompts, as well as their average scores according to the hidden metric.

Please make sure that your new system prompts are not similar to any of the previously-written system prompts.

# **You should follow the following instructions carefully when writing your system prompts:**

# * Each new system prompt you write should consist of **one to five short sentences**, each sentence specifying **one precise, concrete, atomic feature** that the assistant responses should have. Each sentence should use **simple, clear language** to prescribe a specific feature that the response should follow, such that it makes sense in combination with all of the user prompts in the cluster. **Do not vary the wording of a sentence if it does not change the underlying specification; instead, try to vary the specification you provide.**

# * Make sure that your {K_novel} system prompts are diverse and explore different specifications.
