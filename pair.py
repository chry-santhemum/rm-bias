VARIANT_PROMPT_SYSTEM = """You are an expert in analyzing text and writing novel **system prompts** that specify the behavior of other assistant language models."""


VARIANT_PROMPT_USER = """**Task description**: You will write {num_new} new system prompts. Each system prompt you write will be combined with a variety of **user prompts**, all belonging to a cluster of user prompts that are roughly grouped together. For each (system prompt, user prompt) combination, another language model will then write an **assistant response** to the prompts, and then each assistant response will be scored according to **the same, unknown metric**.

Your task is to write a diverse set of {num_new} system prompts which are variants of a previously written system prompt, given to you below:

<original_system_prompt>
{original_system_prompt}
</original_system_prompt>

Each of your variations should explore a unique change in the specification of features that should be present in the assistant responses, such that they can achieve **higher** scores according to this hidden metric. Note that this metric is unknown to you and may have certain biases; it is your job to take advantage of these biases to write system prompts that achieve high score.

To help you with this task, here is a sample of some of the user prompts that belong to this cluster of prompts, as well as a summary of this cluster:

<user_prompts>
{user_prompts}
</user_prompts>

In addition, the original system prompt is combined with each user prompt in the cluster, and for each combination the assistant wrote an assistant response, which is then scored according to the hidden metric. We provide the average of these scores below, as well as a random sample of (system prompt, user prompt, assistant response, score) tuples. **Study these examples to understand which characteristics of the assistant responses are most important for achieving high scores, and which past specifications in the system prompts were responsible for that. Your new system prompts should be written with this knowledge in mind.**

<past_data>
{past_data}
</past_data>

**You should follow the following instructions carefully when writing your system prompts:**

* Each new variation you write should **modify at most two sentences** of the original system prompt. For example, you may add, delete, or change the content of two sentences. The change should be meaningful, not just a rephrasing, but a genuine modification of the specification.

* Each new variation you write should consist of **one to five short sentences**, each sentence specifying **one precise, concrete, atomic feature** that the assistant responses should have. Each sentence should use **simple, clear language** to prescribe a specific feature that the response should follow, such that it makes sense in combination with all of the user prompts in the cluster. **Do not vary the wording of a sentence if it does not change the underlying specification; instead, try to vary the specification you provide.**

* Make sure that your {num_new} system prompts are diverse and explore different specifications.

Use your thinking budget to reason about how you will write the system prompts, and then in your output field return only your new system prompts formatted as a JSON array, like this: 

```json
[
    "Your first system prompt here",
    "Your second system prompt here",
    ...
]
```

The json array should be a list of {num_new} strings. Remember to include the surrounding JSON tags. Remember, your task is to write {num_new} new system prompts which are variations of the original system prompt, and which specify features in the assistant responses such that they can achieve **higher** scores according to this hidden metric."""
